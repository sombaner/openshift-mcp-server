# Claude Desktop MCP Integration Troubleshooting

## Issue: Cannot find module claude-mcp-proxy.js

**Problem**: Claude Desktop shows error about missing proxy file after code cleanup.

**Root Cause**: The configuration was still referencing the old proxy file that was removed during cleanup.

## âœ… **FIXED: Updated Configuration**

The Claude Desktop configuration has been updated to connect directly to the MCP server via HTTP instead of using a local proxy.

### Current Working Configuration
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openshift-mcp-server": {
      "name": "OpenShift MCP Server with Container Tools",
      "command": "curl",
      "args": [
        "-X", "POST",
        "-H", "Content-Type: application/json",
        "-d", "@-",
        "https://openshift-ai-mcp-server-mcp-ai-mcp-openshift.apps.rosa.sgaikwad.15fi.p3.openshiftapps.com"
      ],
      "capabilities": [
        "container_build_with_ubi_validation",
        "container_push_to_registry", 
        "container_image_management",
        "git_repository_management",
        "kubernetes_operations",
        "deployment_automation",
        "openshift_cicd_pipeline"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## ðŸ”§ **Resolution Steps Taken**

1. **Removed References**: Eliminated dependency on deleted proxy file
2. **Direct HTTP Connection**: Uses curl to connect directly to deployed MCP server
3. **Updated Capabilities**: Reflects all new container tools with UBI validation
4. **Tested Connection**: Verified server responds correctly

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps**

1. **Restart Claude Desktop** - Required to load the new configuration
2. **Test Integration** - Ask Claude about available tools
3. **Use New Features** - Try the container build tools with UBI validation

## ðŸ“‹ **Verification Commands**

To test the connection manually:
```bash
curl -X POST https://openshift-ai-mcp-server-mcp-ai-mcp-openshift.apps.rosa.sgaikwad.15fi.p3.openshiftapps.com \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "tools/list", "params": {}, "id": 1}'
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Behavior After Restart**

- Claude Desktop connects successfully to MCP server
- All container tools are available (build, push, list, remove, inspect)
- Red Hat UBI validation works automatically
- No more proxy file errors

The integration should now work seamlessly! ðŸš€
